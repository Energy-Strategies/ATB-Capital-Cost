# Annual Technology Baseline Electricity Data Processing Pipeline

Python files and Jupyter notebooks for processing the Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) electricity data and determining LCOE and other metrics. All documentation and data for the ATB is available at the [ATB website](https://atb.nrel.gov).

## Installation and Requirements
**TODO**

## Notable Directories
- `./lcoe_calculator` Extract technology metrics from the data master `xlsx` file and calculate LCOE using Python.
- `./debt_fraction_calculator` Given data and assumptions in the data master xlsx file, calculate debt fractions using PySAM.
- `./tests` Tests for code in this repository.
